# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Based Stock Trader (w/ Pytorch, JAX, and GYM)

## 1. Introduction
This repository is for introducing stock trading algorithm of multi-agent that follows a policy trained under deep reinforcement learning. 

The algorithm is accelerated and parallelized by using `Pytorch` and `JAX` libraries, and environment is built following `GYM` API.
Unfortunately, the repository is currently under maintenance, but the alpha version is going to be released as soon as possible!


## 2. Usage
***This would be updated soon!***


## 3. Requirements
```
requirements = { 
    numpy>=1.19.0,
    pandas>=0.25.0,
    gym,
    jax,
}
```
