# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Based Auto-Stock Trading System (w/ Pytorch and Gym API)

## 1. Introduction
This repository is for building auto-stock trading system that follows a policy trained with numerical scheme of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.

Currently, the source code of the project is under maintenance but I'm trying to introduce the beta version of it as soon as possible! 

## 2. Usage
***This would be updated soon!***

## 3. Requirements
```
requirements = { 
    numpy>=1.19.0,
    pandas>=0.25.0,
    gym,
    jax,
}
```
